## Description
2 player game
Turn based game
Grid based game

This game called "Connect 4" is a turn-based 2 player game.
This game is played on a 7x6 grid with 7 columns and 6 rows.

Each player takes turns to place a single piece on the grid each, which must be placed only at the lowest available row of each column.
Each piece that has been placed occupies that space in the grid until the game is over.

To win, a player must place 4 pieces next to eachother that align either vertically, horizontally or diagonally against an opponent.
If there are no available spaces left to place pieces, and if neither player has won, the game results in a draw.
